# PPG-NIBE Dataset
The PPG-NIBE dataset provides carefully selected, cleaned,and organized data from the VitalDB Open Dataset, curated to provide high quality, relevant, accurate, and reuseable data, to accelerate research and development for Non-invasive Blood Glucose Estimation.



## Description
This work introduces a curated organized subdataset from the VitalDB vital signs database for photoplethsmoagraphy (PPG) based non-invasive blood glucose estimation (NIBE) research.

VitalDB contains high-resolution multi-parameter data from 6,388 cases, including 486,451 waveform and numeric data tracks of 196 intraoperative monitoring parameters, 73 perioperative clinical parameters, and 34 time-series laboratory result parameters. 

VitalDB is trustworthy, reliable, and frequently used in AI/ML in many fields. Previous research on non-invasive blood glucose estimation methods have found success in using this dataset for model training and development. 

With such a large dataset, researchers must first filter and select the relevant features from VitalDB for NIBE model development. By reducing dataset size and organizing relevant features for PPG-based NIBE, this work lowers the barrier to entry for researchers in the field.
